  caveats <<~EOS
    HatchZip is signed ad hoc, not with a Developer ID, so macOS asks before
    the first launch. On macOS 15 and later, open HatchZip once, then click
    "Open Anyway" in System Settings > Privacy & Security. On macOS 14 and
    earlier, Control-click HatchZip in Applications and choose Open.
